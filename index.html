            thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application.
            Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the
            Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to
            extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into
            other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All
            trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property
            rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service
            Provider.<br>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as
            beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to
            modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for
            any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the
            Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided
            to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is your
            responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the
            Application. The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or
            rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions and
            limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such
            actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs,
            compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the
            Application not functioning correctly or at all.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have
            their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and
            Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the Application:

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="content">
            Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility
            for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application require an active
            internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network
            provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the
            Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to
            Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware
            that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply.
            Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data
            usage during the connection to the application, or other third-party
            charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any such
            charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside
            of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data
            roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are
            using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission from
            the bill payer.<br>Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for
            your usage of the application. For instance, it is your responsibility to
            ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of
            battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider
            cannot be held responsible.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the
            application, it is important to note that while they strive to ensure that
            it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to
            provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The
            Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
            that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality
            of the application.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The
            application is currently available as per the requirements for the
            operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the
            availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to
            download the updates if you want to continue using the application. The
            Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the
            application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the
            particular operating system version installed on your device. However, you
            agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The
            Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application and may
            terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you.
            Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and
            licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using
            the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.
